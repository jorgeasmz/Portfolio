## The Business Challenge

In the financial sector, customer retention is often more valuable than acquisition. However, identifying which customers are preparing to leave (churn) is a complex pattern recognition problem. I built this application to address this challenge by predicting customer churn based on behavioral data.

## Technical Architecture

The project is structured as a complete MLOps pipeline rather than a simple notebook experiment.

### Data Processing & Model Logic
The core of the system relies on a **Random Forest Classifier**. I chose this ensemble method for its distinct advantages in this context:
*   **Handling Non-Linearity:** Customer behavior rarely follows a straight line.
*   **Feature Importance:** It allows us to deduce *why* a customer might leave, not just *if* they will.

The pipeline processes raw customer data—demographics, account balances, and product usage—transforming categorical inputs via **One-Hot Encoding** before feeding them into the model.

### Interactive Interface
A model is only as good as its accessibility. To bridge the gap between Python scripts and the end-user, I integrated **Streamlit**. 

This creates a real-time prediction dashboard where a bank employee can input single customer profiles and receive immediate risk assessments without touching a line of code.

## Key Outcomes

The application successfully demonstrates the full lifecycle of a machine learning project:
1.  **Ingestion:** Automated cleaning of the "Bank Customer Churn Modelling" dataset.
2.  **Persistence:** Model serialization using `joblib` ensures that the API is stateful and efficient, loading pre-trained artifacts instantly.
3.  **Deployment:** A container-ready frontend that decouples the user experience from the complex backend logic.
