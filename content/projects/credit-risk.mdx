## The Business Context

In lending, speed and accuracy are competing goals. Traditional credit scoring is often slow and opaque. I assessed this challenge by building a system that automates the risk evaluation process using the German Credit Dataset. The goal was to create a deployable solution that could demonstrate the usage of machine learning in real-world banking applications.

## System Architecture

Unlike a standalone script, this project mirrors a production microservices environment. I decoupled the logic into three distinct layers:

### 1. Modeling Pipeline
The foundation is a **Random Forest** classifier trained on demographic and financial history data. I implemented a robust `scikit-learn` pipeline that handles:
*   **Data Ingestion:** Automated fetching from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
*   **Preprocessing:** One-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical inputs.
*   **Serialization:** Saving the trained state for high-performance inference.

### 2. Inference API (FastAPI)
The model is exposed via a **FastAPI** REST interface. This choice was deliberate: FastAPI provides automatic Swagger documentation and high-performance asynchronous execution, making it ideal for serving ML predictions as a service.

### 3. Interactive Frontend
To make the model usable by non-technical staff, I built a consumer-facing dashboard using **Streamlit**. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests, maintaining a clean separation of concerns between the user interface and the business logic.

## Key Outcomes

*   **Microservices Design:** successfully demonstrated how to decouple ML models from user interfaces.
*   **Documentation First:** The API is self-documenting, allowing for easy integration with other banking systems.
*   **End-to-End Flow:** From raw CSV data to a deployed web application accessible via a public URL.
